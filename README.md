# pyqt5
 GUI app with pyqt5 for user enter system and also used OOP features 
I have developed a GUI application using the PyQt5 library that incorporates object-oriented programming principles, particularly inheritance. When you run the code, it will generate a database with a ".db" extension. Within this database, a table named "USERS" will be created as per the code's definition. To facilitate this process, I recommend installing "DB Browser for SQLite." This tool allows us to visually examine the generated table and easily upload various types of data into it.
